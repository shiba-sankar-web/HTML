    <pre>        A Letter To The Person Who Didn’t 
        Give Me The Love That I Deserve I 
        guess no answer is answer enough. 
       I’m not important enough to warrant a 
       simple, quick text saying you’re not 
       up for hanging out? I’m not important 
       enough to stick around and wonder 
       where this is going, because the answer is 
       clearly a resounding “nowhere.” 
    It echoes off the walls built by the silence
     you have placed between us 
    so many weeks ago now.
     I’m done waiting for a response, convincing myself that 
     somewhere—even in the far
    back of your mind—is a thought of me that will 
    ring through as if someone tapped a 
    fingernail on a crystal glass. A clear sound to ripple to
     the front of your consciousness 
     and remind you I’m standing by…
      but I’ll stand by no more. I deserve to
    be happy… but so do you.
     Waiting around for something to never 
     happen only promotes the stagnation of life, 
     progression—it halts the future and what it has in store. 
     What so many others our age forget to remember is this:
      love isn’t simply choosing
    to spend your life with someone.
     It is waking up every day and making the daily 
     choice to spend the rest of your 
     life with them. Love isn’t passive, 
     it’s an action—a daily choice. It’s perpetual. 
     But the most important kind of love is the kind
    we most often neglect: self love. 
    I gave that up in my desperate search for love from you, 
    and I lost sight of who I am and what makes me happy. 
    So instead of sitting around waiting for a
     text from you that will probably never come, I’m choosing
    myself every day. 
    To wake up and remind myself that I am strong,
     and worthy of being loved the way I wanted to love you. 
    Someday, I will get that kind of love from another person,
     someone capable of allowing me to love them.

    Here! A Good Man Is The Most Difficult Kind Of Man
     To Love It is a hard thing to love a good man.
     A good man is not a nice man – he does not do things 
     to be nice, he does things because he has a moral code, 
     a set of values he prioritizes and will
    always do his best to make sure that his actions are 
    in line with his own personal standards.
     A good man will not do the easy thing or the convenient thing, 
     or even the thing that he wants to do; he will
      do what he knows to be the good thing.
    He will never lie to you to spare your
     feelings or attend something 
    because social constructs deem it the 
    courteous or polite course of
     action, and he will in fact do
      many things that anger and frustrate you.
      But you cannot get mad at him, because
    after all, he is a good man.
     A good man is the man who will take his ex-girlfriends 
     call while he’s with you, 
     because he knows that she has anxiety and would 
     only ever call in an emergency, 
     and he is obligated as a good man to do whatever he can
    to help even when it makes those around him uncomfortable. 
    A good man will put the wants of friends and
     family before his own needs, 
    even when he recognizes that his friends and family 
    are being manipulative or selfish,
     because a good man is always
    loyal. 
    Worst of all, a good man will believe that his
     unflinching honesty 
    about not wanting a relationship will 
    negate his increasingly relationship-like actions, 
    the kind of thoughtful deeds that a good man
     would deem necessary in any and all
    interactions with a female, despite the 
    onfusion they would cause.

    Love That Every Person Deserves You deserve someone
     who does not only make you feel better, 
     but makes you want to be better. He supports
    you and your goals. 
    He’d listen to you blabber about your studies like 
    it’s the most interesting topic in the world. 
    When you’re about to give up, he’d be your cheerleader.
     He would keep you motivated all the way. 
     You deserve someone who is utterly
    obsessed with you. He would randomly place notes 
    in between book pages because he knows it would make you smile.
     He would call you at 2am just to 
     tell you he wants to hear your voice.
      He would drive for 3 hours just to see you for an hour because
    he misses you. 
    He would send you peonies because he knows you love them.
     He would text you good morning not
      because he feels obligated to do so, 
     but because you’re the first thing on his mind 
     from the moment he wakes up. You deserve to be treated
    like a choice, not an option. You are not someone’s “maybe.”
     He would treat you like a priority.
      He would love you consistently. 
      He would always be there especially whenever you need him. 
      He would make an effort to be with you. 
      He would show you that you are his one and only.</pre>
